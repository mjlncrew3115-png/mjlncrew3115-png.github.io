Its strengths are that it provides free access to scientific satellite data and has many layers of information, but its weakness is that the large amount of data can be overwhelming for casual users. It offers GIS functionality such as layering, time-series visualization, and geographic search. The application is designed for researchers, educators, and policy makers who need access to satellite data. The user interface is powerful but can feel complex, and I would redesign it to make the menus and data layers a bit easier to navigate."],

Its strengths are that it is government-backed and reliable, while its weakness is that it loads slowly and looks dated compared to newer applications. It offers GIS functionality such as topographic visualization, download of spatial data, and measurement tools. The application is designed for researchers, students, and the public who want detailed geographic data of the U.S. The user interface works but is not very modern, and I would redesign it to be faster and more visually appealing."]
